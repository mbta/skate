### Global Settings / Style

Examples of typography styles found in Skate, based on defaults from
Reboot with some modifications. This roughly follows the outline of
the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/content/typography/">
Bootstrap typography documentation</a> adapted specifically for Skate.
The sections that follow below are all rendered with Skate, as opposed
to Storybook, styling.

<Unstyled>
  The default font is Inter. Body text is 1rem, 400 weight,
  [$gray-900(#141524)](?path=/docs/design-system-colors--documentation#color-gray).
  <p>
    {"Paragraph text. When body text is"}
    <br />
    {"in paragraphs, we use 150% line height."}
  </p>
  <p>Between paragraphs, there is 1rem of spacing.</p>
  <p>
    <span>
      <a href="#">Link text</a> is also 1rem, 400 weight, using the primary
      color
      ([$eggplant-500](?path=/docs/design-system-colors--documentation#color-eggplant)).
    </span>
  </p>
</Unstyled>

    <span>
      This is a lead paragraph. Lead paragraphs stand out from regular
      paragraphs with 300 weight, 1.25rem font size, and 1.5 line height.
    </span>
  </p>
</Unstyled>

### Inline Text Elements

You can use the <ins>inserted tag</ins> for text that has been added to the document.

You can use the <u>underline tag</u> for underlined text.

You can use the <small>small tag</small> for text that is to be treated as fine print.

You can use the <strong>strong tag</strong> for bold text.

### Lists

<Unstyled>
  <ul class="list-unstyled">
    <li>
      <span>This is a list with the `list-unstyled` style applied.</span>
    </li>
    <li>It appears completely unstyled but is still structurally a list.</li>
    <li>However, it only applies to its immediate children.</li>
    <li>
      <span>
        A nested list will get normal formatting unless the class is added to
        it. Note that for now, `_base.scss` interferes with this example.
      </span>
      <ul>
        <li>Like this.</li>
        <li>For example.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
</Unstyled>
