# Global Settings / Style

Examples of typography styles found in Skate, based on defaults from
Reboot with some modifications. This roughly follows the outline of
the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/content/typography/">
Bootstrap typography documentation</a> adapted specifically for Skate.
The sections that follow below are all rendered with Skate, as opposed
to Storybook, styling.

    }
    <br />
    {"In paragraphs, we use 150% line height."}
  </p>
  <p>Between paragraphs, there is 1rem of spacing.</p>
  <p>
    <span>
      <a href="#">Link text</a> is also 1rem, 400 weight, using the primary
      color ($eggplant-500).

# Lists

<Unstyled>
  <ul class="list-unstyled">
    <li>
      <span>
        This is a list with the <code>list-unstyled</code> style applied.
      </span>
    </li>
    <li>It appears completely unstyled but is still structurally a list.</li>
    <li>However, it only applies to its immediate children.</li>
    <li>
      <span>
        {
          "A nested list will get normal formatting unless the class is added to it."
        }
      </span>
      <ul>
        <li>Like this.</li>
        <li>For example.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <span>
        Note that for now <code>_base.scss</code> interferes with the above
        example.
      </span>
    </li>
  </ul>
</Unstyled>
