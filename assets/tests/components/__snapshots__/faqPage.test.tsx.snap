    Frequently Asked Questions about Skate
  </h1>
  <h2>
    The Basics
  </h2>
  <h3>
    What is Skate?
  </h3>
  <p>
    Skate is a bus tracking tool that inspectors can use on MBTA-issued Samsung tablets or any other machine with web access. The first version includes 
    <strong>
      route ladders and is available now.
    </strong>
     Skate is meant to give bus inspectors timely information that helps you keep service running well for MBTA riders. It’s a collaboration between MBTA Bus Operations and the Customer Technology Department.
  </p>
  <h3>
    Does it just do route ladders? 
  </h3>
  <p>
    We are actively developing and improving Skate. You can expect to see
    <strong>
      new features for headway management, shuttle tracking, changing bus labels from vehicle IDs to run IDs or badge numbers, and schedules in the coming months.
    </strong>
     
    We welcome input on features and tweaks that would be useful to you.
  </p>
  <h3>
    What’s the difference between Skate, Swiftly, TransitMaster/Citrix, and Samsara?
  </h3>
  <p>
    Skate includes route ladders similar to those in TransitMaster/Citrix, with several improvements and upcoming features based on conversations we had with bus inspectors and other MBTA staff. Unlike TransitMaster/Citrix, Skate can be accessed on MBTA-issued Samsung tablets or any other device with an internet connection (computers, phones, etc.). It also includes high-frequency bus locations from the Samsara trackers installed on all buses, as well as the operator/run/status info from TransitMaster units. We encourage you to use Skate because it’s an MBTA (not a vendor) application and we have full control of the features. That means we tweak and improve this tool to make sure it’s the best tool possible for you and other MBTA staff.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>
      TransitMaster
    </em>
     is the MBTA’s computer-aided dispatching system that is used by operators (units in buses), dispatchers at OCC, and officials and helps us track our vehicles and service. It does a lot “behind the scenes,” including managing bus/OCC radio comms, but also includes dispatcher tools like Playback and BusOps (e.g., route ladders, a schedule tab, and a roster tab). 
    <em>
      Citrix
    </em>
     is a way of accessing TransitMaster and is usable on desktop computers, old Citrix handhelds, but not tablets or phones.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>
      Swiftly
    </em>
     is the MBTA’s vendor for real-time bus predictions, but also includes a live map of bus service that is available to bus officials. Its web-based dashboard allows you to track scheduled bus (not shuttle) service in real time and replay historical vehicle movements (by route or by an individual vehicle). The vehicles appear on a map, not on route ladders. The dashboard can be accessed on mobile phones, tablets, and computers, although it works much better on a computer with a large screen.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>
      Samsara
    </em>
     is the vendor of the new GPS devices on each of the buses. Samsara supplements the less-frequent location updates we get from TransitMaster. Samsara also has a nice tracking dashboard that bus maintenance uses because it includes bus location but also vehicle diagnostic data. Ops and instruction staff are welcome to also use it, even though it doesn’t have the operator/work information present in TransitMaster and Swiftly.

  <h3>
    Where/how could I provide feedback on Skate? 
  </h3>
  <p>
    We definitely want to hear from you and other bus inspectors!

      Fill out a form
    </a>
     if you’re experiencing an error, or have a question or ideas for improvement. We’ll do our best to respond as quickly as possible to the email address you provide. Soon we’ll also send out a survey you could fill out to help us evaluate the usability of the tool and ultimately improve it.
  </p>
  <h3>
    How do I request help for my tablet?
  </h3>
  <p>
    If you want training or help with your Samsung tablet, call the MBTA Help Desk at x5761 and ask them to assign the ticket to the “Realtime Applications Team” with a callback number that works for you. We’ll reach out to schedule a time with you. If you just need help obtaining or resetting your email password, the Help Desk should be able to help you on the phone right there.

  <h2>
    SKATE SPECIFICS
  </h2>
  <h3>
    Can I “save” or “add” my preferred routes?
  </h3>
  <p>
    Not yet, but it’s a feature that is high on our priority list. We’re working on saving your most-viewed/selected routes to the local browser storage, which will mean you will no longer have to re-open your selected routes after your tablet falls asleep. Keep an eye out!
  </p>
  <h3>
    Is there a maximum number of route ladders I can have open on Skate?
  </h3>
  <p>
    It depends. We suggest having no more than 9-10 open route ladders on a tablet. A computer has more power and will be able to handle more ladders at once, but Skate is expected to get slower as more routes ladders are open.
  </p>
  <h3>
    Can I filter my ladders by garage/station/timepoint/etc?
  </h3>
  <p>
    Unfortunately not yet. This is a helpful feature offered by Swiftly. We’re working on adding the option to filter routes by timepoint, garage, inspector post, and stop.
  </p>
  <h3>
    Can I track shuttle buses on Skate?
  </h3>
  <p>
    You will be able to very soon! Once we launch this feature in the coming months you’ll be able to track shuttles by run number and view shuttle routes in a map view. We’ll have a training session once we roll out shuttle tracking to make sure you’re all set up to use it optimally.
  </p>

    What do the different colored icons mean?
  </h3>

  <h3>
    Can I customize the color scheme to my preference?
  </h3>
  <p>
    We don’t offer this option at the moment, but you might see it added at some point. Stay tuned!
