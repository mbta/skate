  # When we prepare a HASTUS export for a new rating for Skate, the export's

  # current date. This allows us to import the new rating data as soon as it's
  # ready, rather than having to try to import it at the moment the new rating
  # is starting. But it also means that, at any given moment, Skate's HASTUS
  # data contains a significant number of trips that belong to either a past
  # or future rating.
  #
  # These trips will have a nil service_id. So do all non-revenue trips, but
  # since a piece should always have at least one revenue trip, if all trips
  # in a piece have a nil service_id, we can assume that all those trips are
  # from a non-current rating.
