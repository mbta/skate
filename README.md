# Skate

Skate is a web-based dispatch tool for bus inspectors, built by the MBTA. Imagine an app that helps you track the one bus you want to catch, but instead it’s helping us track all the buses that everyone wants to catch! It has the rich location data driving our mbta.com and rider apps, but also info that matters for keeping things running smoothly (operator names, bus numbers, shift schedules). For background, read our [“Skate: Building a better bus dispatch app (and how it will improve your ride)”](https://medium.com/mbta-tech/skate-building-a-better-bus-dispatch-app-and-how-it-will-improve-your-ride-51965d8ef7b9) blog post.

## Community

The MBTA Customer Technology Department supports a shared Slack channel that transit agencies and partners adapting the Skate code can use to collaborate and ask questions. To be invited to the Slack channel, email [developer@mbta.com](mailto:developer@mbta.com).

## Setup

Doing development on Skate requires Elixir, Erlang, and node, as dsecribed in [.tool-versions](https://github.com/mbta/skate/blob/master/.tool-versions). Most developers use [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/) to help manage the required versions, but that isn't required.

Skate also requires Postgres. If you don't already have Postgres installed, and you're on a Mac, [Postgres.app](https://postgresapp.com/downloads.html) is an easy way to get started. However, any Postgres instance to which you can connect and in which you have sufficient privileges should work.

Quick setup:

1. Install languange dependencies with `asdf install`
1. Install Elixir dependencies with `mix deps.get`
1. Install Node.js dependencies with `cd assets && npm install`
1. Install Postgres by your favorite method, possibly by downloading the latest install image from the [Postgres.app download page](https://postgresapp.com/downloads.html), opening it, and copying the Postgres.app application into Applications.
1. To create the database, back in the Terminal, `` env `cat .env` mix ecto.create && env `cat .env` mix ecto.migrate ``

## Running the application

- Start Phoenix endpoint with `` env `cat .env` mix phx.server `` (for bash. For fish use: `env (cat .env) mix phx.server`)
- Visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

## Running tests

- Run Elixir tests with `` env `cat .env` mix test `` (for bash. For fish use: `env (cat .env) mix test`)
- Run Javascript tests with `cd assets && npm test`

## Configuring to run in a new environment

There are a number of configuration details defined in environment variables. These define where data sources live, as well as authentication and CDN details. See `.env.example` for naming and syntax.

- **GTFS_URL**: Location of the GTFS zip file
- **BUSLOC_URL**: Source of GTFS-realtime enhanced VehiclePositions json data file
- **SWIFTLY_REALTIME_VEHICLES_URL**: Source of Swiftly vehicle data
- **SWIFTLY_AUTHORIZATION_KEY**: for dev only, see below for prod
- **SKATE_HASTUS_URL**: Source of extended schedule data
- **TRIP_UPDATES_URL**: Source of GTFS-realtime enhanced TripUpdates json data file (optional)
- **API_URL**: URL of the API for retrieving live train positions
- **API_KEY**: Access key for the API (For dev only, see below for prod. We want API_KEY to come from SecretsManager in prod, but that doesn't work for dev. So the env var lets you continue setting the value locally for development.)
- **ENVIRONMENT_NAME**: The first part of the key names in SecretsManager (only required in production)
- **RELEASE_COOKIE**: Used by Erlang (only required in production)
- **COGNITO_DOMAIN**, **COGNITO_CLIENT_ID**, **COGNITO_CLIENT_SECRET**, **COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID**, **COGNITO_AWS_REGION**, and **GUARDIAN_SECRET_KEY**: Authentication/authorization details (only required in production)
- **STATIC_SCHEME**, **STATIC_HOST**, **STATIC_PATH**, and **STATIC_PORT**: CDN details (only required in production)
- **SENTRY_BACKEND_DSN**, **SENTRY_FRONTEND_DSN**: Endpoints for logging errors to Sentry (optional, only used in production)
- **POSTGRES_USERNAME**, **POSTGRES_HOSTNAME**: Postgres username and hostname (optional in dev, default to system username and "localhost" respectively. Required in production.)
- **POSTGRES_PASSWORD**: Postgres password (optional in dev, defaults to blank string. Not used in production.)
- **POSTGRES_PORT**: Port to connect to Postgres (optional, defaults to 5432, the standard Postgres server port)

Additionally, there a number of secret variables (only required in production) defined in [AWS SecretsManager](https://console.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager):

- **API_KEY**: Access key for the API
- **COGNITO_CLIENT_SECRET**: Authentication/authorization secret
- **GUARDIAN_SECRET_KEY**: Authentication/authorization secret
- **SECRET_KEY_BASE**: Used for writing encrypted cookies. Generate a value using `mix phx.gen.secret` (only required in production)
- **SWIFTLY_AUTHORIZATION_KEY**: Authorization key for Swiftly
